# Bike Sharing - Linear Regression
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
The company wants to know: 
a. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
b. How well do those variables describe the bike demands? 
The model to decide on the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables is to be created. 
It will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Technologies Used
python
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
statsmodels
statsmodels.api

## Conclusions
* The demand for bikes depends on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer, and winter.
* Temp is the most significant with the largest coefficient. 
* Followed by weathersit_Light Snow & Rain. 
* Bike rentals are more for the month of September. 
* The rentals are reduced during holidays. 
* This indicates that bike rentals are majorly affected by temperature, season and month.
